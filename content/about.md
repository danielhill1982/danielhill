# About

I'm a photo shooter, story teller, design creator, software developer and game player, music listener, bike cycler, train passenger and apartment rentener from europe based in germany, thuringia.

I was improving my computer knowledge since 1999 as a media designer, specialized in nonprint-design and world wide web. While working and sharing with software developers, I learned how to implement brand websites independently.
