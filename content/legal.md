### Relevant Legal Bases:

Relevant legal bases according to the GDPR: In the following, you will receive an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR, on the basis of which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the regulations of the GDPR, national data protection regulations in your or our country of residence may apply. If, in individual cases, more specific legal bases are relevant, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy. Legitimate Interests (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f) GDPR: The processing is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, which require the protection of personal data, prevail. National data protection regulations in Germany: In addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national regulations on data protection in Germany apply. This includes in particular the law to protect against misuse of personal data in data processing (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG). The BDSG contains in particular special regulations on the right to information, the right to deletion, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, the processing for other purposes and the transmission as well as automated decision-making in individual cases including profiling. Furthermore, state data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply. Note on the application of the GDPR and Swiss DSG: These data protection notices serve both to provide information according to the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (Swiss DSG) and according to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this reason, we ask you to note that due to the broader spatial application and comprehensibility, the terms of the GDPR are used. In particular, instead of the terms “processing” of “personal data”, “predominant interest” and “particularly worthy of protection personal data” used in the Swiss DSG, the terms used in the GDPR “processing” of “personal data” and “legitimate interest” and “special categories of data” are used. However, the legal meaning of the terms is still determined within the scope of the application of the Swiss DSG according to the Swiss DSG.

### Security Measures:

We take measures in accordance with legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art.
