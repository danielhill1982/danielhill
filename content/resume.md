# Resume

I am looking for projects to successfully implement my extensive knowledge and long experience in web design.

Interested in working on solo projects or as a consultant with a focus on logo design, corporate design, information design, redesign, animation, photo, content-management-systems, search-engine-optimization, responsive design, and UI/UX design concepts, or frontend design with programming. Beyond that I have the ability to connect to other professionals to work with me on the projects.

This is my homepage. I have published several private websites since starting my education. Now it is limited to this info-website.

This page is designed, created, and programmed using open-source software on a Windows computer in Europe and Germany.

Programmed with Visual Studio Code under Windows 11 Professional on a gaming PC. I used the CSS framework Tailwindcss with PrelineUI in Nuxt and Node.js, a cross-platform open-source JavaScript runtime environment here.

However, the design and code of this website are not available for sale or reuse, without permission and without mentioning my name.

For comments or questions, simply send me an email. Or connect with my public online profile links, that you can find as following list.

I am a passionated but pensionated media designer because my health is not 100%.

I look forward to your comments, criticism, or questions.
